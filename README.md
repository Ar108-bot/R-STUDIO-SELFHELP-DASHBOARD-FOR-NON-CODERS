# R-STUDIO-SELFHELP-DASHBOARD-FOR-NON-CODERS
THIS SELFHELP DASHBOARD IS FOR THE NON CODERS FOR BASIC HELP USING AI.
When you download the helper app from GitHub, you may notice that it is released under the MIT License. This is one of the simplest and most common open-source licenses.

For you, as a reader and user of this book, this means:

✅ You can download and use the app freely.

✅ You can copy it, share it, or even modify it for your own purposes.

✅ You don’t need special permission to use it in research, teaching, or projects.

⚠️ The only rule is: if you share the app with others, you should keep my name and the license note attached.

⚠️ The app is provided “as is” — meaning I am not responsible if it doesn’t work on your computer, causes errors, or fails in some way.

In short: the MIT License gives you freedom to use the app without legal worries, while also protecting me from being held responsible if anything goes wrong.
# R Error Helper App

This Shiny app is designed for beginners who use R but don’t know how to fix coding errors.  
It connects to OpenAI’s GPT model to suggest corrected code.

## How to Use

1. Install R and RStudio.
2. Install the required packages in R (only once):
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "httr", "jsonlite"))
