# R-STUDIO-SELFHELP-DASHBOARD-FOR-NON-CODERS
THIS SELFHELP DASHBOARD IS FOR THE NON CODERS FOR BASIC HELP USING AI.
When you download the helper app from GitHub, you may notice that it is released under the MIT License. This is one of the simplest and most common open-source licenses.
A small Shiny app that helps R users (especially biologists & environmentalists who don‚Äôt code) diagnose and fix R errors. The app sends your pasted R code + error to your own OpenAI account and returns a corrected code suggestion and a plain-English explanation.

‚ö° Quick start (5 minutes)

Download this repository (green Code ‚Üí Download ZIP).

Install R and RStudio (see below).

Open app.R in RStudio.

Get an OpenAI API key (see below), paste it into the app, then click Get Help.

Paste the code and the error message, click Get Help, and read the suggestion.

If you prefer detailed, step-by-step instructions, read on.

üì¶ What‚Äôs in this repository

app.R ‚Äî the Shiny app. Save it locally and run it in RStudio.

LICENSE ‚Äî MIT license (you can use & modify freely).

README.md ‚Äî this file.

üîß Prerequisites (what readers need)

A computer (Windows/Mac/Linux).

R (free) and RStudio Desktop (free).

A free OpenAI account (to get an API key).

Internet access (the app calls the OpenAI API).

1) Install R and RStudio

Install R from CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/.

Install RStudio Desktop (free) from Posit: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.
(Just download the installers and follow the normal ‚ÄúNext ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Finish‚Äù steps.)

2) Install required R packages (one-time)

Open RStudio and copy-paste the following into the Console and press Enter:

install.packages(c("shiny", "httr", "jsonlite"))


If one of these is already installed, R will skip it.

3) Download & open the app

Click Code ‚Üí Download ZIP in this repo, then extract the ZIP file.

Open RStudio. From the menu: File ‚Üí Open File‚Ä¶ and choose app.R from the extracted folder.

(Optional) In RStudio you can set working directory to the location of app.R: Session ‚Üí Set Working Directory ‚Üí To Source File Location.

4) Get your OpenAI API key (how & where)

Go to the OpenAI developer platform: https://platform.openai.com/.

Create an account or sign in.

In the top-right menu, choose View API keys or go to API keys.

Click Create new secret key (copy the key immediately ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be able to see it again).

Important notes:

OpenAI keys are secret ‚Äî do not publish or share them. OpenAI documents and recommends keeping keys private. 
OpenAI Help Center

You may need to verify your account (phone/email) and set up billing to use the API beyond any free credits. See OpenAI billing instructions.

5) Run the app locally

With app.R open in RStudio, run the app by entering the command in the Console:

shiny::runApp()


A browser window should open (or a Viewer pane) showing the app UI.

Paste your OpenAI API key into the API Key (password) box in the app (do not share this key with anyone).

Paste your R code in the "Paste your R code here" box and your error message in the "Paste the error message here" box, then click Get Help.

The app will return a suggested corrected code snippet and an explanation.

Alternative: store your API key locally (advanced, optional)

If you prefer not to type the key into the UI each time, create a file named .Renviron in the same folder as app.R (or in your home directory) with one line:

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"


Then restart RStudio. The app can be adapted to read Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"). Do not commit .Renviron to GitHub. Add it to .gitignore (see below).

6) Security & best practices

Never commit your API key to GitHub or share it in public. Treat it like a password. OpenAI provides guidance on API key safety. 
OpenAI Help Center

If your key is exposed, revoke it immediately from your OpenAI dashboard and create a new one. 
OpenAI Help Center

If you store a key locally, keep .Renviron out of version control by adding a .gitignore with the line:

.Renviron


A minimal .gitignore you can add to the repo:

# Ignore local credentials
.Renviron

7) Common problems & fixes (don‚Äôt panic)

Problem: Error: package 'shiny' not found
Fix: Run install.packages("shiny") in the Console; restart R.

Problem: API error: ‚ÄúUnauthorized‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvalid API Key‚Äù
Fix: Check that you pasted the key exactly; keys start with sk-. If you created a key recently, copy it again from your OpenAI dashboard. If the problem continues, generate a new key in your OpenAI account. 
OpenAI Help Center

Problem: App does not start / blank screen
Fix: Restart RStudio and run shiny::runApp() again. Make sure your working directory is where app.R is saved.

Problem: You got an OpenAI error about billing or credits
Fix: Check your OpenAI account billing page ‚Äî you may need to add payment or check credits. 
Zapier

If you can‚Äôt solve the problem:

Copy the exact error message.

Open a new GitHub Issue in this repository (click Issues ‚Üí New issue) and paste the error + a short description of what you tried. (Do not paste your API key.)

Someone (or the repo maintainer) can respond.

8) Notes about costs & API usage

This app uses your personal OpenAI account for requests, so you are billed by OpenAI, not the repo owner. You should check OpenAI pricing and your usage. 
Zapier

9) Want to run the app without typing the key each time?

Advanced option: edit app.R to read Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") and set your key in .Renviron (see section ‚ÄúAlternative‚Äù above). Again‚Äîdo not commit .Renviron.

10) If you want a hosted (no-setup) version

If you prefer your readers not to install anything, you can deploy the app to shinyapps.io or another hosting platform. That requires a deployment account and a hosted API key decision (you would need to manage billing & security). For this book we use the DIY model so each reader uses their own OpenAI key.

11) License

This project is released under the MIT License ‚Äî you are free to use, copy, and modify the code. See LICENSE for details.

Final reassuring note (for non-coders)

This app is a helper ‚Äî not a magic wand. If you copy-paste your code and an error, treat the suggestion as a guided hint. If it doesn‚Äôt work the first time, breathe, read the small error message again, and try the fix (or open an Issue). You have full control ‚Äî and you can always revoke your API key and create a new one if needed.

12) How to Get Help / Report Issues

If you face a problem running the app, here‚Äôs what you should do:

Check the ‚ÄúCommon problems & fixes‚Äù section (Point 7 above).
Most errors (missing packages, invalid API key, etc.) can be solved by following those steps.

If the problem continues, create a GitHub Issue:

Go to this repository page in your web browser.

At the top, click the Issues tab.

Click the green New issue button.

Give your issue a clear title, like ‚ÄúError: shiny app won‚Äôt start‚Äù.

In the description box, paste:

The exact error message you see in RStudio.

Your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux).

Your R version and RStudio version (find this in RStudio under Help ‚Üí About RStudio).

What you already tried from the troubleshooting list.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not paste your API key anywhere. It is private, like a password.

Wait for help.

The repo maintainer (or someone from the community) will reply on the GitHub Issue page.

You can log back into GitHub anytime to check for responses.
